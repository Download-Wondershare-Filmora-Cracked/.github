Multilayer Editing: Filmora allows you to add multiple video, audio, and text layers. This means you can overlay multiple clips, add background music, and incorporate text effects or animations in separate layers, controlling each element independently.

Green Screen (Chroma Key): You can replace a green or blue background with any image or video to create professional-level scenes. This feature is popular for special effects, enabling virtual backgrounds or scene changes.

Keyframing: Filmoraâ€™s keyframe tool lets you create animations by setting points of change over time. You can apply keyframes to attributes like opacity, position, and scale, allowing for smooth transitions and dynamic movement within a scene.

Audio Ducking: This feature allows users to lower the volume of background music or sounds automatically when a voice-over or narration is present, enhancing audio clarity and making videos more engaging.

Speed Ramping: Speed ramping provides more nuanced control over the playback speed within a clip, making it possible to slow down or speed up certain moments. This feature is widely used for creating dramatic effects in action or sports footage.

### 2. Advanced Color Grading

Color Matching: Filmoraâ€™s color matching tool lets you automatically match the color tone of two different clips, ensuring a cohesive look throughout the video. This is particularly helpful when using footage from multiple cameras.

LUTs and Presets: Filmora offers several pre-set Look-Up Tables (LUTs), allowing you to apply stylized color grades instantly. You can also import custom LUTs, offering more flexibility for professionals aiming for specific aesthetics.

Advanced Color Correction Tools: Beyond basic brightness, contrast, and saturation adjustments, Filmora provides controls for shadows, highlights, whites, and blacks, letting users fine-tune colors for each frame.

### 3. Motion Tracking

Filmoraâ€™s motion tracking feature lets you select an object or a person in a clip and track its movement throughout. This is especially useful for adding elements like text, stickers, or effects that follow a subject within the scene.

### 4. 3D LUT and Effects Libraries

3D LUT: In addition to basic LUTs, Filmora provides cinematic 3D LUTs, which add a film-like quality to footage, mimicking popular movies or scenes. These can be combined with Filmoraâ€™s effects libraries, which offer overlays, transitions, and filters to stylize your video. Effects Library: Wondershare Filmora provides a library of effects like glitch, cinematic overlays, bokeh, and other trendy filters to give videos a unique aesthetic. You can also download new effects from Filmstock for more customization options.

### 5. Split-Screen Effects and Masking

Split-Screen Presets: This feature enables you to showcase multiple videos within one frame, with pre-set layouts. You can adjust each video frame individually to fit specific scenes, making it ideal for comparison or showing simultaneous action.

Masking and Blending Modes: With advanced masking tools, you can create shapes to hide or reveal parts of a video. Blend modes allow for different overlays or artistic effects by merging one video with another, enhancing creative possibilities.

### 6. Text and Title Customization

Animated Text Effects: Beyond basic text overlays, Filmora offers animated text effects and custom fonts, including 3D titles. You can control the textâ€™s path and orientation for dynamic presentations.

Advanced Typography Settings: Users can change font, size, color, spacing, and more. Filmora allows text animation with keyframes and transitions, so you can apply more dynamic storytelling elements.

### 7. Integration with Filmstock
